# Customer-Conversion-Prediction

This project aims to predict customer conversion for an insurance company. Using historical data, we will develop a machine learning model that can identify which customers are most likely to purchase a policy. By understanding the patterns and behaviors of previous customers, the model can make predictions and provide valuable insight to the company. The objective is to increase the rate of successful conversions and ultimately improve the company's bottom line.
